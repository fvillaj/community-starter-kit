### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: I'm a description for development needed
- **qa-needed**: I'm a description for qa needed
- **documentation-needed**: I'm a description for documentation needed
- **bug-high-priority**: I'm a description for a high priority bug
- **bug-low-priority**: I'm a description for a low priority bug
- **help-wanted**: I'm a description for help wanted

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
